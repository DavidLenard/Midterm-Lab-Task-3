# [Midterm Lab Task 3]
- This portfolio demonstrates how to create an interactive Excel dashboard that tracks Data Science salary trends and job patterns. It looks at job distribution, salary changes by role and company size, and sector-based employment trends using pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map.
  
## Step by Step Process

1. Use the given data  
   - Open the Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the Transform Tables:  
     - Sal By Role  
     - Sal By State  
     - Sal By Size  

2. Design the dashboard to highlight the following:  
   - State with the most Data Science jobs  
   - Job role with the highest average salary  
   - Company size that pays the highest salary  
   - Sector with the lowest & highest number of Data Science jobs  
   - Sector with the minimum & maximum average salary  

3. Create a pivot table  
   - Use pivot tables to summarize data for sector jobs and salary (d & e)  

4. Generate charts for reports  
   - Use bar, column, or pie charts to visualize salary trends and job distribution  

5. Insert slicers for filtering  
   - Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive  

6. Add a map (optional)  
   - If available in your Excel version, insert a map visualization to show job distribution by state  

7. Apply design & formatting  
   - Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make the dashboard visually appealing  

8. Complete the dashboard  
   - Ensure all required visuals and reports are included  
   - The slicers should be functional and interactive
